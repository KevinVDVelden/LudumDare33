This is an entry for the Ludum Dare 33 compo.
Made by Kevin van der Velden.

The game is made with:

- Python (3.4)
- PyGame
- Numpy

"Art" was made using a combination of ImageMagick, Spartan and Paint.NET.
Excepting the font, which was downloaded from: 
http://opengameart.org/content/kenney-fonts

There is much that I want to add, and I might do so in a later release.
Code is available for download at https://github.com/KevinVDVelden/LudumDare33
